Is a document retrieval and information system for the **Department of Science and Technology Provincial Science Technology Center of Bulacan**. It aims to provide easy retrieval of the documents frequently used in the organization's operation by providing a database of digitalized copy of the documents.

#### Integrated Technologies
This project is based on Java FX and will utilize the following technologies
1. Afterschool Creatives Polaris
2. MariaDB for SQL Database
3. FileZilla FTP Server for File Storage
4. Apache Commons Net 3.6

#### Description
The project covers the most basic operations of the organization.
1. Incomming/Outgoing Communications
2. Shared Forms and Templates
3. SETUp
4. Shared Folders

Since the project is file intensive it will be integrated with an experimental algorithm that will assure that the files are copied in each active terminal in the local network of the organization.

It will utilize Afterschool Creatives **Redundant Storage Algorithm** ( RSA ). RSA maintains to provide local copy of the digitalized documents to each active terminal in the network to avoid data loss.
